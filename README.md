First create a database using xampp control panel with two columns naming username and password and store the data in username as "admin" and password as "admin123"
Keeping the control panel open, open login1 file from the project and run it.
Enter the login credentials as per saved in the database. 
If any errors in code please include opencv package to the project.
To run the project you need to create an input in the local file directory 
Eg: "F:/canny_input.jpg"
